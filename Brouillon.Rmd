abstract : \singlespacing Empirical evidence suggests an increasing cynicism among Canadian citizens,
  which would be partly rooted in the belief that politicians often break their
  promises. Whether it is in response to this sentiment, to act as politicians’ 
  watchdogs or to democratize factual information about politics, experts have 
  started to create campaign pledge evaluation tools (CPET) in the last decade. 
  Using Justin Trudeau’s Polimeter as a case study, this paper seeks to determine 
  the effect of CPETs on Canadian citizens’ perceptions of the Liberal Party of 
  Canada’s (LPC) ability to fulfill election promises. Using data from the Canadian 
  Electoral Studies between "2015" and '2021', we evaluate indicators of public 
  salience and mistrust during election periods based on socio-economic status and
   specific survey responses. We cross-reference these results with data from 
  Trudeau’s Polimeter, allowing a comprehensive analysis of how citizens’ 
  perception of the LPC evolved over time. By aggregating data on verdicts, major 
  issues and the number of page clicks from the Polimeter website with the 
  Canadian Electoral Studies, we develop a unique dataset on citizen-government 
  perception dynamics. Preliminary findings suggest noteworthy correlations 
  between Polimeter web site traffic data on the pledges related to important 
  issues of survey respondents. This article contributes to a novel body of work 
  on the dynamic between CPETs and public trust by exploring if such tools 
  correlate with a decline in mistrust when it comes to describing how politicians 
  uphold their electoral promises.

# Introduction

Having a relative or an acquaintance expressing their distrust against the government or more generally the political system is a common situation for many. Phrases such as : "The whole system is corrupt", "Politics are a rigged game for the elites" or "Politicians never keep their campaign promises", can be heard in many contexts where the public expresses their opinion about issues or simply discuss political events. The latter typical sentence mentioned earlier has been addressed by some scholars and political experts that did the effort to document campaign pledges realization statuses. To do so, many platforms were created to vulgarise and inform the public to what extent governments keep their promises once they've been elected. These platforms are called *Campaign pledge evaluation tools* (CPETs). Starting in 2009 with the *Obameter*, many other CPETs were created in different contexts, but few efforts have been done to study their effects on the public and if they really are fulfilling their mission to convince the public of the real situation of promise keeping by politicians. This lack of knowledge on the contribution of these tools is what Tremblay-Antoine (2020) mentioned in her systematic review of CPETs. No studies have been found to show a causality between the possible influence of CPETs and people's perceptions of the political system and its components. Suggesting that CPETs should be studied in various political and cultural context to find out more about the indicators of the relation between "pledge-to-policy linkages and citizens' political views and behaviors" (Tremblay-Antoine, 2020) has inspired this paper to explore this new phenomenon in a particular context which is : Canada.

Another major inspiration for this paper was three Instagram posts from Radio-Canada which are now deleted, hence unsourcable. Using data from a Canadian CPET, the Polimeter, each of these posts showed some of Trudeau's campaign pledges realization status, being either kept, broken, or partially kept, each post having 10 promises from these three categories. At the moment of observing that Instagram post, it has been noticed that there were 2100 likes for the broken pledges publication, compared to 400 likes for kept and 200 likes for partially kept. This situation seems to highlight the particular attention from the public towards broken plegdes, and raises the question of the negativity bias. This concept was popularised by Rozin and Royzman (2001) and implies that negative entities are stronger than positive entities when exposed to humans (Rozin and Royzman, 2001). Assuming that kept pledges are positive and broken ones are negative, having such disparity between the two of them is potentially a sign of a negativity bias in the Canadian population. The fact that partially kept pledges, which are more "negative" than kept ones are being the most ignored promises puts up at front the possibility that entities in between negative and positive do not specifically bring attention from the public. Nonetheless, such a situation rose the question of the information contained in web pages events concerning the attitudes and behaviors of the population. 

# Decoding User Engagement

Since CPETs are being generally found on the internet, it is important to explore the different possibilities that offers us these new platforms. This could potentially leads us to identify patterns in the public opinion when it is exposed to these information outlets. Indeed, this paper is centered around concepts found in the dynamic world of digital marketing. To understand user behavior, the focal point often rests on Click-through Rates (CTRs), serving as a key indicator of user engagement (Danaher, 2007). In fact, click-through logs are invaluable and can benefit a wide range of search-related applications, such as user satisfaction estimation (Zhu et al., 2011). As we delve into the intricacies of this metric, several trends and considerations emerge, shaping the landscape for the scientists. The art of anticipating CTR trends has evolved with the integration of machine learning algorithms and AI-driven analytics. These tools serve as navigational aids, helping marketers and scientists predict user behavior. An understanding of the global dynamics is essential for accurate CTR predictions. Cultural shifts, regional preferences, and societal trends significantly impact user engagement in diverse markets (Danaher, 2007).
 
Another way of examining the prediction of clicks comes from the study of Randolph E. Bucklin and Catarina Sismeiro (2003). In their study, the authors use a type II tobit model to assess and measure the rates of clicks (Bucklin, Sismeiro, 2003). Indeed, they develop a modeling approach to understand some of the basics around the site-browsing behavior at the individual level (Bucklin, Sismeiro, 2003). The scientists used two variables to determine and evaluate the behaviors of the people. The first one resides in the manifest by page request (Bucklin, Sismeiro, 2003). In other words, going to another link on the page you were shows the intent from the individual to stay on the site. The same goes for going back, etc. Users determine the rate of page views themselves with how often they click on links during a session (Danaher, 2007). The second dependent variable is the time someone stays on the same page (Bucklin, Sismeiro, 2003). According to Google Support, the duration on the platform Google Analytics is measured using the total duration of all engaged sessions (in seconds) divided by the number of sessions (Google Analytics, 2023).  Using these two variables, the authors found that users reduce their expected number of page views when they come back to the same site. This leads us to one of our hypothesis :\newline 
 
*H1) We expect to find stronger coefficients in Google Analytics when using views from a user or the average duration by session compared to other types of data from Google Analytics.* 

# Public perception, media malaise and negativity bias
 
Media effect and information seeking affects the users drastically (Ceron, 2015). In the article by Andrea Ceron (2015), it is shown that the media malaise theory has an extensive effect on political trust. It can even generate cynicism throughout the population, hence decreasing trust in the political institutions (Ceron, 2015). The media malaise theory states that the content that is presented on the platforms does not give a fair coverage, so the bad is presented first to give attraction to a media outlet or link, thus creating an ambiance of mistrust in this sphere (Robinson, 1976). When it comes to decision making, political trust is an important aspect. Another study shows that traditionally, a government can be closely associated to a “thin” and not “thick” trust (Zhu et al., 2011, p.10). This is also affecting the population’s cynicism. On the other end, a positive algorithm has shown that it can increase confidence in the institutions and create a virtuous circle (Norris, 2000, p.309).

The respect for electoral promises is central to the concept of representative democracy. It is the responsibility of the ruling party to address the wishes of the population by implementing the policies outlined in their electoral program (Downs, 1957). The way governments fulfill their promises influences voters' evaluation of the government and their electoral choices. In fact, voters tend to penalize political parties that have not kept their commitments and re-elect those who have fulfilled their electoral promises (Born, van Eck, and Johannesson, 2018).
 
Most governments in Western democracies generally manage to fulfill the majority of their promises (Naurin, 2011). In Canada, most commitments made by the ruling parties during electoral campaigns are realized, either entirely or partially (Costello, O’Neill, and Thomson, 2016). However, a minority of the population believes that political parties keep their promises. Moreover, many voters make an erroneous assessment of the realization of electoral promises (Duval and Pétry, 2020). There is, therefore, a disparity between the rate of broken promises and citizens' perception. This disparity could be partly explained by the fact that voters primarily gather information through the media (Weaver, 1996). However, the media only present a filtered sample of information (Lippmann, 1922). How the media choose and present this information can influence citizens' evaluation of the government's performance (Kleinnijenhuis and Van Hoof, 2009).
 
According to Müller (2020), there is a lower level of media coverage for fulfilled promises compared to broken promises. Moreover, increased media attention on broken promises seems to have risen in recent years. This negative bias is particularly pronounced regarding promises related to the economy. Since the media exert considerable influence on voters' perception of politics, constant attention to unfulfilled promises could contribute to citizens perceiving politicians as untrustworthy (Müller, 2020).
 
In addition to the higher media coverage for broken promises, citizens tend to adopt selective exposure, meaning they search for information that confirms their preconceived ideas and avoid those that contradict their opinions (Porumbescu, 2018). Consequently, citizens who already have a negative view of the ruling party will be more inclined to select negative media information and, by extension, be more interested in broken promises. The importance given to unfulfilled promises in the media could exert a negative influence on citizens' trust in politicians. In fact, trust in politicians significantly decreases among those who believe politicians do not keep their promises and that they only make such promises to gain votes, without genuinely intending to implement them once in power (Rose and Wessels, 2019). This influence is particularly important considering that broken promises have more weight than fulfilled promises in voters' evaluation of the government (Naurin et al., 2019).
 
In addition to being an essential source of information, the media are used as heuristic shortcuts. Obtaining information about the level of realization of electoral promises requires a certain level of political sophistication, time, and knowledge. That's why many people use the medias as decision-making shortcuts, i.e., information used to form a quick opinion on a subject without having to conduct in-depth research (Lupia, 1994). However, the use of heuristic shortcuts often distorts citizens' evaluation of political parties' commitment fulfillment (Pétry and Duval, 2017).
 
However, the influence of negative biases present in the media does not have the same effect on all citizens. Indeed, political sophistication plays a mediating role. Individuals with greater political sophistication appear less influenced by negative media biases (Chang, 2018; Desmet et al., 2015). The political sophistication includes interest, involvement, and political knowledge (Converse, 1964). According to Zaller (1992), individuals who are highly attentive and interested in politics are more likely to gather information through the media and, consequently, be exposed to media messages. However, they are less influenced by these messages because their interest in politics provides them with knowledge that allows them to filter information. The most politically sophisticated voters generally gather information from a greater quantity and better quality of sources and are generally able to assess the realization of electoral promises more accurately (Thomson and Brandenburg, 2019). 
Thus, our second hypothesis is based on such theories : \newline

*H2) Voters with a higher level of political knowledge and interest should be more inclined to use information seeking media such as CPETs.*


# Data

In order to verify such claims, this paper will be applying aggregated Google Analytics data from the Polimeter's website on the answers of respondants of the Canadian Electoral survey of 2021. To clarify, the Polimeter is a Canadian campaign pledge evaluation tool (CPET) that tracks the electoral promises of ruling parties on the provincial as well as the federal level (Tremblay-Antoine et al., 2020; Trudeau Polimeter, 2015). As said earlier in this article, part of it's inspiration came from the Polimeter's data. In fact, this CPET is dividing the possible verdict of a campaign pledge in 5 ways : *"Kept", "Partially Kept", "Broken", "In progress" and "Not yet rated"*. However, in the case of our study, the last two verdict possibilities aren't aligning with the theories mobilized, and are in that cased not considered for the analysis we are going to do. Only keeping the others will allow us to link page views on the polimeter website with negative or positive entities, and then possibly find a tendency of political trust among Polimeter users. In that regard, we chose to only analyse pledges from Trudeau's first and second mandate. The reason for this is that *In progress* and *Not yet rated* pledges are to be classified as one of the three other possible verdicts when a mandate is over. Indeed, a campaign pledge can only be linked to it's respective mandate and therefore can not be applied to the next one. Since the third mandate is not closed, there are still *In progress* and *Not yet rated* in it, which makes the classification of pledges verdicts more time consuming. Keeping only closed mandates leaves us with datasets already adapted to our research questions.
